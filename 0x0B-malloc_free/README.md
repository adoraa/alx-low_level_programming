# 0x0B. C - malloc, free

This repository contains tasks on memory allocation and deallocation in C, given by the ALX School, and instructed by Julien Barbier. The repository is divided into two subfolders: mandatory and optional tasks.

## Table of Contents

- Mandatory Tasks
- Optional Tasks

## Mandatory Tasks

The mandatory tasks folder contains five tasks that you need to complete. They include:
- [0. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee](0-create_array.c)
- [1. The woman who has no imagination has no wings](1-strdup.c)
- [2. He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life](2-str_concat.c)
- [3. If you even dream of beating me, you'd better wake up and apologize](3-alloc_grid.c)
- [4. It's not bragging if you can back it up](4-free_grid.c)

The tasks involve memory allocation and deallocation using malloc and free functions. I learnt how to allocate and free memory dynamically, create and manipulate dynamic arrays, and work with structures.

## Optional Tasks

The optional tasks folder contains two tasks that you can choose to complete if you're up for a challeng. They include:

- [5. It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe](100-argstostr.c)
- [6. I will show you how great I am](101-strtow.c)

These tasks are designed to test your understanding of memory allocation and deallocation, and you'll need to apply the concepts learned in the mandatory tasks to complete them.
