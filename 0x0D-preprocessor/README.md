# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor

This directory contains tasks on C preprocessors, given by the ALX School and instructed by Julien Barbier & Johan Euphrosine, Software Engineer at Google (for this particular project). The repository includes tasks that demonstrate the usage and functionality of preprocessors in C programming.

## Description:

The tasks in this repository demonstrate different aspects of preprocessors in C programming. Each task has its own set of requirements and associated files.

### Task 0: Object-like Macro

Create a header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.

### Task 1: Pi

Create a header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.

### Task 2: File Name

Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.
  - You are allowed to use the standard library

### Task 3: Function-like Macro

Write a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

### Task 4: SUM

Write a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.
