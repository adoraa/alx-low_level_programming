# 0x0C. C - More malloc, free

This directoy contains tasks on dynamic memory allocation and manipulation in C, given by the ALX School and instructed by Julien Barbier.

## Mandatory Tasks

The mandatory tasks consists four tasks. They include:

- [0. Trust no one](0-malloc_checked.c)
- [1. string nconcat](1-string_nconcat.c)
- [2. calloc](2-calloc.c)
- [3. array range](3-array_range.c)

The tasks involve dynamic memory allocation and manipulation using functions such as malloc, calloc, realloc, and free. I learnt how to allocate memory for strings, concatenate strings with a specific length, create and manipulate dynamic arrays, and resize dynamically allocated memory.

## Optional Task

The optional task consists of two additional task. They include:

- [4. realloc](100-realloc.c)
- [5. We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope](101-mul.c)

This task is designed to further enhance our understanding of dynamic memory allocation and manipulation. We are required to apply the concepts learned in the mandatory tasks to complete these tasks.i
